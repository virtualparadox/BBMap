Description:  Fuses sequences together, padding gaps with Ns.

Usage:   fuse.sh in=<input file> out=<output file> pad=<number of Ns>

Input may be stdin or a fasta, fastq, or sam file, compressed or uncompressed.
Output may be stdout or a file.

Optional parameters (and their defaults)

in=<file>            The 'in=' flag is needed if the input file is not the 
                     first parameter.  'in=stdin' will pipe from standard in.
out=<file>           The 'out=' flag is needed if the output file is not the 
                     second parameter.  'out=stdout' will pipe to standard out.
pad=300              Pad this many N between sequences.
quality=30           Fake quality scores, if generating fastq from fasta.
overwrite=t         (ow) Set to false to force the program to abort rather 
                     than overwrite an existing file.
ziplevel=2          (zl) Set to 1 (lowest) through 9 (max) to change 
                     compression level; lower compression is faster.
fusepairs=f         Default mode fuses all sequences into one long sequence.
                    Setting fusepairs=t will fuse each pair together.

Java Parameters:
-Xmx                This will be passed to Java to set memory usage, overriding
                    the program's automatic memory detection.  -Xmx20g will 
                    specify 20 gigs of RAM, and -Xmx200m will specify 200 megs.
                    The max is typically 85% of physical memory.
