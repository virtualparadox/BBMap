Description:  Compares reads to the kmers in a reference dataset, optionally 
allowing an edit distance. Splits the reads into two outputs - those that 
match the reference, and those that don't. Can also trim (remove) the matching 
parts of the reads rather than binning the reads.

Usage:	bbduk2.sh in=<input file> out=<output file> fref=<contaminant files>

Input may be stdin or a fasta, fastq, or sam file, compressed or uncompressed.
Output may be stdout or a file.
If you pipe via stdin/stdout, please include the file type; e.g. for gzipped 
fasta input, set in=stdin.fa.gz

Optional parameters (and their defaults)

qout=auto           Output quality offset: 33 (Sanger), 64, or auto.

Processing parameters:

k=27                Kmer length used for finding contaminants.  Contaminants 
                    shorter than k will not be found.  k must be at least 1.
rcomp=t             Look for reverse-complements of kmers in addition to 
                    forward kmers.
maskmiddle=t        (mm) Treat the middle base of a kmer as a wildcard, to 
                    increase sensitivity in the presence of errors.
maxbadkmers=0       (mbk) Reads with more than this many contaminant kmers 
                    will be discarded.
hammingdistance=0   (hdist) Maximum Hamming distance from ref kmers (subs only).  
                    Memory use is proportional to (3*K)^hdist.
editdistance=0      (edist) Maximum edit distance from ref kmers (subs and indels).  
                    Memory use is proportional to (8*K)^edist.
forbidn=f           (fn) Forbids matching of read kmers containing N.  By default, 
                    these will match a reference 'A' if hdist>0 or edist>0, to 
                    increase sensitivity.
maxns=-1            If non-negative, reads with more Ns than this 
                    (before trimming) will be discarded.
removeifeitherbad=t (rieb) Paired reads get sent to 'outmatch' if either is 
                    match (or either is trimmed shorter than minlen).  
                    Set to false to require both.
findbestmatch=f     (fbm) If multiple matches, associate read with sequence 
                    sharing most kmers.  Reduces speed.

Speed and Memory parameters:

threads=auto        (t) Set number of threads to use; default is number of 
                    logical processors.
prealloc=f          Preallocate memory in table.  Allows faster table loading 
                    and more efficient memory usage, for a large reference.
minrskip=1          (mns) Force minimal skip interval when indexing reference 
                    kmers.  1 means use all, 2 means use every other kmer, etc.
maxrskip=99         (mxs) Restrict maximal skip interval when indexing 
                    reference kmers. Normally all are used for scaffolds<100kb, 
                    but with longer scaffolds, up to K-1 are skipped.
rskip=              Set both minrskip and maxrskip to the same value.
                    If not set, rskip will vary based on sequence length.
qskip=1             Skip query kmers to increase speed.  1 means use all.
speed=0             Ignore this fraction of kmer space (0-15 out of 16) in both
                    reads and reference.  Increases speed and reduces memory.
Note: Do not use more than one of 'speed', 'qskip', and 'rskip'.

Trimming/Masking parameters:

ktrim=f             Trim reads to remove bases matching reference kmers.
                    Values: 
                            t (trim)
                            f (don't trim), 
                            r (trim right end), 
                            l (trim left end), 
                            n (convert to N instead of trimming).
                    Any non-whitespace character other than t, f, r, l, n: 
                    convert to that symbol rather than trimming, and process 
                    short kmers on both ends.
useshortkmers=f     (usk) Look for shorter kmers at read tips (only for 
                    k-trimming).  Enabling this will disable maskmiddle.
mink=6              Minimum length of short kmers.  Setting this automatically 
                    sets useshortkmers=t.
qtrim=f             Trim read ends to remove bases with quality below minq.
                    Performed AFTER looking for kmers.
                    Values: 
                            t (trim both ends), 
                            f (neither end), 
                            r (right end only), 
                            l (left end only).
trimq=6             Trim quality threshold.
minlength=10        (ml) Reads shorter than this after trimming will be 
                    discarded.  Pairs will be discarded only if both are shorter.
maxlength=          Reads longer than this after trimming will be discarded.  Pairs 
                    will be discarded only if both are longer.
minavgquality=0     (maq) Reads with average quality (before trimming) below 
                    this will be discarded.
otm=f               (outputtrimmedtomatch) Output reads trimmed to shorter than 
                    minlength to outm rather than discarding.
tp=0                (trimpad) Trim this much extra around matching kmers.
tbo=f               (trimbyoverlap) Trim adapters based on where paired 
                    reads overlap.
minoverlap=24       Require this many bases of overlap for overlap detection.
mininsert=25        Require insert size of at least this much for overlap 
                    detection (will automatically set minoverlap too).
tpe=f               (trimpairsevenly) When kmer right-trimming, trim both reads 
                    to the minimum length of either.
forcetrimleft=0     (ftl) If positive, trim bases to the left of this position 
                    (exclusive, 0-based).
forcetrimright=0    (ftr) If positive, trim bases to the right of this position 
                    (exclusive, 0-based).
restrictleft=0      If positive, only look for kmer matches in the 
                    leftmost X bases.
restrictright=0     If positive, only look for kmer matches in the 
                    rightmost X bases.

Java Parameters:

-Xmx                This will be passed to Java to set memory usage, overriding 
                    the program's automatic memory detection. -Xmx20g will specify 
                    20 gigs of RAM, and -Xmx200m will specify 200 megs.  
                    The max is typically 85% of physical memory.
