	echo "Input may be a fasta, fastq, or sam file, compressed or uncompressed."
	echo "Output may be stdout or a file.  'out' and 'hist' are both optional."
	echo ""
	echo "Optional parameters (and their defaults)"
	echo ""
	echo "Input parameters:"
	echo "in2=null		Second input file for paired reads"
	echo ""
	echo "Output parameters:"
	echo "out=<file>        	Print kmers and their counts"
	echo "mincount=1        	Only print kmers with at least this depth"

	echo "Hashing parameters:"
	echo "k=31			Kmer length (1 to 31)"
	echo "prealloc=t 		Pre-allocate memory rather than dynamically growing; faster and more memory-efficient.  A float fraction (0-1) may be specified, default 1."
	echo "prefilter=0		If set to a positive integer, use a countmin sketch to ignore kmers with depth of that value or lower."
	echo "prehashes=2		Number of hashes for prefilter."
	echo "prefiltersize=0.2	Fraction of memory to use for prefilter."
#TODO	echo "minq=6			Ignore kmers containing bases with quality below this."

	echo "threads=X		Spawn exactly X hashing threads (default is number of logical processors).  Total active threads may exceed X due to I/O threads."
	echo "onepass=f		If true, prefilter will be generated in same pass as kmer counts.  Much faster but counts will be lower, by up to prefilter's depth limit."

	echo "           		-Xmx20g will specify 20 gigs of RAM, and -Xmx200m will specify 200 megs.  The max is typically 85% of physical memory."
