Description:  Counts the number of unique kmers in a file.

Usage:   kmercountexact.sh in=<file>

Input may be a fasta, fastq, or sam file, compressed or uncompressed.
Output may be stdout or a file.  'out' and 'hist' are both optional.


Input parameters:
in=<file>           Primary input file.
in2=<file>          Second input file for paired reads.

Output parameters:
out=<file>          Print kmers and their counts.
fastadump=t         Print kmers and counts as fasta versus 2-column tsv.
mincount=1          Only print kmers with at least this depth.
reads=-1            Only process this number of reads, then quit (-1 means all).

Hashing parameters:
k=31                Kmer length (1 to 31)
prealloc=t          Pre-allocate memory rather than dynamically growing; faster and more memory-efficient.  A float fraction (0-1) may be specified, default 1.
prefilter=0         If set to a positive integer, use a countmin sketch to ignore kmers with depth of that value or lower.
prehashes=2         Number of hashes for prefilter.
prefiltersize=0.2   Fraction of memory to use for prefilter.
minq=6              Ignore kmers containing bases with quality below this. (TODO)
minprob=0.0         Ignore kmers with overall probability of correctness below this.
threads=X           Spawn X hashing threads (default is number of logical processors).
onepass=f           If true, prefilter will be generated in same pass as kmer counts.  Much faster but counts will be lower, by up to prefilter's depth limit.
rcomp=t             Store and count each kmer together and its reverse-complement.

Histogram parameters:
khist=<file>        Print kmer frequency histogram.
histcolumns=2       2 columns: (depth, count).  3 columns: (depth, rawCount, count).
histmax=100000      Maximum depth to print in histogram output.
histheader=f        Set true to print a header line.
nzo=t               (nonzeroonly) Only print lines for depths with a nonzero kmer count.

Peak calling parameters:
peaks=<file>        Write the peaks to this file.  Default is stdout.
minHeight=2         (h) Ignore peaks shorter than this.
minVolume=2         (v) Ignore peaks with less area than this.
minWidth=2          (w) Ignore peaks narrower than this.
minPeak=2           (minp) Ignore peaks with an X-value below this.
maxPeak=BIG         (maxp) Ignore peaks with an X-value above this.
maxPeakCount=8      (maxpc) Print up to this many peaks (prioritizing height).

Quality parameters:
qtrim=f             Trim read ends to remove bases with quality below minq.
                    Values: t (trim both ends), f (neither end), r (right end only), l (left end only).
trimq=4             Trim quality threshold.
minavgquality=0     (maq) Reads with average quality (before trimming) below this will be discarded.

Overlap parameters (for overlapping paired-end reads only):
merge=f             Attempt to merge reads before counting kmers.
ecc=f               Error correct via overlap, but do not merge reads.   

Java Parameters:
-Xmx                This will be passed to Java to set memory usage, overriding the program's automatic memory detection.
                    -Xmx20g will specify 20 gigs of RAM, and -Xmx200m will specify 200 megs.  The max is typically 85% of physical memory.
