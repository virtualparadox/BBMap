Description:  Filters a sam file to select only reads with substitution errors
for bases with quality scores in a certain interval.  Used for manually 
examining specific reads that may have incorrectly calibrated quality scores.

Usage: filtersubs.sh in=<file> out=<file> minq=<number> maxq=<number>

Parameters:
in=<file>       Input sam or bam file.
out=<file>      Output file.
minq=0          Keep only reads with substitutions of at least this quality.
maxq=99         Keep only reads with substitutions of at most this quality.
countindels=t   Also keep reads with indels in the quality range. 
keepperfect=f   Also keep error-free reads.
