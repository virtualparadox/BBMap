Description:  Reorders reads randomly, keeping pairs together.

Usage:  shuffle.sh in=<file> out=<file>

Input may be stdin or a fasta, fastq, or sam file, compressed or uncompressed.
Output may be stdout or a file.

Optional parameters (and their defaults)

in=<file>           The 'in=' flag is needed if the input file is not the first parameter.  'in=stdin' will pipe from standard in.
in2=<file>          Use this if 2nd read of pairs are in a different file.
out=<file>          The 'out=' flag is needed if the output file is not the second parameter.  'out=stdout' will pipe to standard out.
out2=<file>         Use this to write 2nd read of pairs to a different file.

overwrite=t         (ow) Set to false to force the program to abort rather than overwrite an existing file.
showspeed=t         (ss) Set to 'f' to suppress display of processing speed.
ziplevel=2          (zl) Set to 1 (lowest) through 9 (max) to change compression level; lower compression is faster.
fint=f              (fixinterleaving) Fixes corrupted interleaved files by examining pair names.  Only use on files with broken interleaving.
shuffle=t           (rp) Fixes arbitrarily corrupted paired reads by examining read names.  High memory.
ain=f               (allowidenticalnames) When detecting pair names, allows identical names, instead of requiring /1 and /2 or 1: and 2:

Java Parameters:
-Xmx                This will be passed to Java to set memory usage, overriding the program's automatic memory detection.
                    -Xmx20g will specify 20 gigs of RAM, and -Xmx200m will specify 200 megs.  The max is typically 85% of physical memory.
